## üöÄ Features

- **Trained Artificial Neural Network** (ANN) model leveraging dense layers and nonlinear activations for accurate heart disease risk prediction.
  
- Uses **UCI Cleveland dataset** with 13 key clinical features: age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG, thalach, exercise angina, ST depression, slope, major vessels, thal.
  
- **Delivers real-time probability scores** and categorizes risk as Low, Medium, or High based on model output.
  
- **Integrated SHAP explanations** highlight feature contributions and promote AI interpretability for each patient input.
  
- **Health comparison table** dynamically benchmarks user values against clinical normal ranges.
  
- **Personalized lifestyle recommendations** generated from abnormal feature values.
  
- **Achieves strong model accuracy**: **92%** (precision: 0.91/0.93, recall: 0.94/0.89, F1-score: 0.92/0.91).
  
- **Responsive dashboard UI** built with React for seamless patient entry, result visualization, and interactivity.
  
- **Fast and secure API** communication powered by Flask backend.
